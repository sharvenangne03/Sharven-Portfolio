<h1>About Me</h1>
<br />
<h2>Hello, I'm Sharven Angne!</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm thrilled to share a bit about who I am, both professionally and personally.
</p>
<hr />
<h3>Professional Background:</h3>
<p>
  With a solid foundation in education—holding a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Masters in Computer Applications—I've ventured into the world of web development. My journey began with a 6-month internship, honing my skills as a web developer, and has since evolved into a full-time role, where I continue to explore the vast and ever-evolving landscape of web technologies.

<h3>Achievements Beyond the Code:</h3>
<p>
  While I thrive in the digital realm, my passion extends beyond lines of code. I've had the honor of playing in a semi-professional football league, where I not only captained the team to victory in the DSO football championship but also led us to the top 16 group stage out of a whopping 275 teams. Football has always been more than a game for me—it's a testament to teamwork, strategy, and relentless pursuit of goals.

<h3>Diverse Interests:</h3>
<p>
  Away from the screen, you'll find me immersed in various interests. I express my creativity through canvas paintings, find joy in playing the Casio, and seek adventure on the open road with a love for bike riding. Traveling and exploring new places is a passion that fuels my curiosity, and occasionally, I indulge in the world of computer and mobile games for some digital escapism.

<h3>Connecting Through Shared Experiences:</h3>
<p>
  I believe in the power of shared experiences, and I'm excited to connect with you—whether it's over a shared love for web development, football, art, music, or the thrill of exploring new places.
